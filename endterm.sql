
-- By default, the parameterâ€™s type of any parameter in
-- PostgreSQL is IN parameter. You can pass the IN
-- parameters to the function but you cannot get them
-- back as a part of result.
--
--
-- The OUT parameters are defined as part of the function
-- arguments list and are returned back as a part of the
-- result.
--
--
-- The INOUT parameter is the combination IN and OUT
-- parameters.
-- It means that the caller can pass the value to the
-- function.
-- The function then changes the argument and passes
-- the value back as a part of the result.
--
--
-- A PostgreSQL function can accept a variable number
-- of arguments with one condition that all arguments
-- have the same data type.
-- The arguments are passed to the function as an array.
